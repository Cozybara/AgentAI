       "   'content': '**Nintendo Co., Ltd.** is a Japanese multinational video game and entertainment company headquartered in Kyoto. The history of Nintendo began when craftsman Fusajiro Yamauchi founded the company to produce handmade *hanafuda* playing cards. The company became internationally dominant in the 1980s after the arcade release of *Donkey Kong \"Donkey Kong (1981 video game)\")* (1981) and the Nintendo Entertainment System, which launched outside of Japan alongside *Super Mario Bros.* in 1985. Nintendo was founded as Nintendo Koppai on 23 September 1889 by craftsman Fusajiro Yamauchi in Shimogyō-ku, Kyoto, Japan, as an unincorporated establishment, to produce and distribute Japanese playing cards, or karuta (かるた; from Portuguese *carta*, \\'card\\'), most notably *hanafuda* (花札, \\'flower cards\\'). His first actions involved several important changes in the operation of the company: in 1951, he changed the company name to Nintendo Playing Card Co., Ltd. and in the following year, he centralized the manufacturing facilities dispersed in Kyoto, which led to the expansion of the offices in Kamitakamatsu-cho, Fukuine, Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto. In 1953, Nintendo became the first company to succeed in mass-producing plastic playing cards in Japan.',\n",
